            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Our connection with the foods we eat has become increasingly distant over the last few decades, influenced largely by the complex systems that bring sustenance to our plates. This issue is especially apparent in large cities such as New York.</p>
            <p>Such a disconnect raises challenges as we work to improve public health, combat climate change and protect the environment. What are we missing out on by not being more aware and involved in our food systems? And how can communities in metropolitan areas restore those connections?</p>
            <p>Yemi Amu founded Oko Urban Farms, New York City's first public outdoor aquaponics farm. The farm combines soil-free fish and plant cultivation and strives to familiarize local residents with the benefits of the ecological farming method.</p>
            <p>Timothy Berkelbach, a computational quantum chemist at the Simons Foundation's Flatiron Institute, is developing new techniques to enable more efficient and affordable methods of accelerating chemical reactions. Called catalysis, this process is critical to the food industry, and Berkelbach's work has potential real-world applications in developing environmentally friendly practices in food production and farming.</p>
            <p>As deputy director of strategy and policy at the NYC Mayor's Office of Food Policy, Milagros de Hoz works at the intersection of food, the environment and climate. She coordinates with local, state and regional leaders to advance sustainable and low-carbon-emission food initiatives.</p>
            <p>Join them as they sit down with Kelsa Trom, the Simons Foundation's community network manager, for a discussion that examines the food system challenges we face and sheds light on some of the innovative ways in which scientists, community members and local governments are planning for the future of food.</p>

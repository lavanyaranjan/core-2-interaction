        <div class="grid-item" id="PartOne">For a long time it was believed that these impenetrable books corresponded to past or remote languages.</div>
        <div class="grid-item"></div>  
        <div class="grid-item" id="PartTwo">It is true that the most ancient men, the first librarians, used a language quite different from the one we now speak; it is true that a few miles to the right the tongue is dialectical and that ninety floors farther up, it is incomprehensible.</div>
        <div class="grid-item" id="PartThree">All this, I repeat, is true, but four hundred and ten pages of inalterable MCV's cannot correspond to any language, no matter how dialectical or rudimentary it may be.</div>
        <div class="grid-item" id="PartFour">Some insinuated that each letter could influence the following one and that the value of MCV in the third line of page 71 was not the one the same series may have in another position on another page, but this vague thesis did not prevail.</div>  
        <div class="grid-item"></div>
        <div class="grid-item" id="PartFive">Others thought of cryptographs; generally, this conjecture has been accepted, though not in the sense in which it was formulated by its originators.</div>

            <p>At that time a great deal was said about the <span style="font-size:20px"><b>Vindications</b></span>: books of apology and prophecy which vindicated for all time the acts of every man in the universe and retained prodigious arcana for his future.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="PartTwo">
            <p>Thousands of the greedy abandoned their sweet native hexagons and rushed up the stairways, urged on by the vain intention of finding their Vindication.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="PartThree">
            <p>These pilgrims disputed in the narrow corridors, proferred dark curses, strangled each other on the divine stairways, flung the deceptive books into the air shafts, met their death cast down in a similar fashion by the inhabitants of remote regions. Others went mad... The Vindications exist (I have seen two which refer to persons of the future, to persons who are perhaps not imaginary) but the searchers did not remember that the possibility of a man's finding his Vindication, or some treacherous variation thereof, can be computed as zero.</p>

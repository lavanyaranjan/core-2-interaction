        1. The first time I used the internet myself was to show my dad my Pizza Parlor on Friv. 

        2. I was thriving as the owner and was 100% sure that this 5-year-old would be a masterchef. But when I opened my browser, I couldn’t type. 
        
        3. I knew was the website looked like, it was purple and green and had a loud and funny song playing but how was I supposed to spell it?
        
        4. My mom usually opened it for me but she wasn’t at home, and I had to have it open and ready before Dad got back. So I pressed F and then started pressing whichever key I could think of. When I finally reached R, the first line turned purple!
        
        5. So I clicked it and Friv.com was alive without me typing the entire name. That’s when I decided that the internet was the coolest thing ever.
